this is a short description of how to project works

1.
the vis.py script will extract data from my github account using the github api and uploads it to a mongodb database that is ran on a docker container started with a compose

2.
the vis2.py script then take the data from the mongodb database and parse the relevent data into a csv file for use in the java script file.

3.
the index.html file calls the index.js file which takes the csv data and presents it in the webpage using d3.

4.
the d3 software is used to present a bar chart of the number of repos of github accounts that i follow. this gives a general visualisation of software engineering skill compared
to each other where the users with a higher github repo count will have a larger bar than others that have a lower count. this visualises a rough description of skill of 
different github accounts
